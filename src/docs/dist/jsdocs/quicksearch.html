The main features are: System independent Components are self-contained Separation between private and public assets Mobile first loading assets on demand for better performance Automatically generated styleguide Frontend Stack: nodejs Grunt Vanilla JS handlebars.js (Template-Engine) basket.js (Store files in localstorage) importer.js (Load components on demand) AngularJS jQuery SASS BEM (CSS naming convention) PostCSS (grunt task for post processing CSS e.g. autoprefixer, pixrem, stylelint) BrowserSync (syncronised browser testing) ESLinter (Javascript linter) HTMLHint (validate HTML markup) Getting startedInstallation Checkout repository from https://github.com/brandung/capitan to your local folder Navigate to the folder 'capitan/' and run npm install Start a new project For first initialization of your project type: grunt project:init Choose your destination system (standardized structure with &quot;dist&quot; folders is the default system) Path to your Public folders will be set automatically, based on the information set in the choosen system JSON file Browsersync opens up the components page (styleguide) Start your work Start working on an existing project To start Browsersync type: grunt project:serve Browser Sync opens up the components page Start your work TasksThese are the most common capitan tasks Task Description grunt project:init Initialize project grunt project:serve Task for your daily work (after initialisation) grunt project:finish Uglify and concatenate your private assets grunt project:lint Lint your html, sass and private js files grunt project:export Do the finish task and export your files for presentation grunt create:component --name=[COMPNAME] Create new component grunt create:zip Do the same as Project:export and ZIP your application grunt create:styleguide Reads the variables from the Sass Variables-Partial and transports them into the template partials that are part of the components page grunt update:grunt Donwloads the latest workflow files from github and copies them into the corresponding folders. Excluding the following folders:capitan/src.gitignorecapitan/grunt/*.jscapitan/grunt/systems&quot; Folder structure within 'capitan/src/' Folder name Description component Your project components js Global javascript files sass Global sass files templates Global template files componentAll your components will be placed here. Components are self-contained, meaning that the component folder contains everything the component needs to be displayed and worked correctly. When you run the create component task a folder with the name you specified will be created inside the components folder. The created folder will look like this: [COMPNAME] ├──[COMPNAME].hbs ├──[COMPNAME].scssFurthermore this task will append the component template to the components page and create an Importer entry in the global.js file (see Global JS). A more complex component including JS and 3rd party files can look like this: [COMPNAME] ├──[COMPNAME].hbs ├──[COMPNAME].scss ├──[COMPNAME].js ├──js ├────libs ├──────vendor ├────────[LIBNAME] ├──────────[LIBNAME].min.css ├──────────[LIBNAME].min.jsIf you have a component JS file or additional vendor files, you have to add them to the Importer entry. The compiled component files will be placed in the directory that is specified in the global.js file. Vendor files will be copied to that directory (see Global JS): [PUBLIC-PATH] + 'components/[COMPONENT-NAME]/component.js' [PUBLIC-PATH] + 'components/[COMPONENT-NAME]/component.css' [PUBLIC-PATH] + 'js/libs/vendor/[LIBNAME]/[LIBNAME].min.js' [PUBLIC-PATH] + 'js/libs/vendor/[LIBNAME]/[LIBNAME].min.css' Components are bringing several advantages: dependency injection only use component if needed portability can be copied over to another project overview all relevant files are in one place dependency on third party or global files jsThe global.js file and the function, util, handle folders are located here. Functions, Utils and Handles are Scripts that are not bound to a specific component. They are stored in the Capitan.Function, Capitan.Util and Capitan.Handle objects and can be used globally. The getBreakpoint-Function for example, returns the current breakpoint based on the window with (Capitan.Function.getBreakpoint()). function ├──... util ├──... handle ├──... global.jssassThe core Sass files folder. Beside others the Variables Sass-File is part of the partials folder. Capitan uses the normalize, html5 boilerplate and bootstrap grid system libraries which are placed inside the vendor folder. Styles that should be loaded on every page are defined inside the main.scss file. Most of the time you should include your components through the importer to keep the main.css file size low. But if you have a component that needs to be styled right from the start (like the main navigation), you can add it to the main.css file and remove it from the global.js. This way its styles will not be loaded asynchronously, but compiled into the main.css file. This makes sense if you have a component that is visible above the fold and you want its styles to be applied instantly. partials ├──... vendor ├──... main.scsstemplatespartials ├──includes | ├──... ├──layouts | ├──base.hbs views ├──index.hbs ├──styleguide.hbsStyleguideCapitan generates a styleguide for you. Colors, breakpoints and icons that are defined in the Sass Variables-Partial (sass/partials/_variables.scss) will be generated into your styleguide. Also all of your components will be included into the styleguide.hbs automatically (if you use the task grunt create:component --name=[COMPNAME]). This process is part of the grunt project:init and grunt project:serve tasks. It reads the variables and transports them into the template partials that are part of the components page. While running the grunt project:serve task, your styleguide will automatically be updated if changes are made. If you just want to generate the styleguide you can use the grunt create:styleguide Task. WidgetThe Styleguide-Widget is located at the right side of the components page and provides a better overview of your components. Its features are: Hide/ show components (all at once or one by one) Display a grid overlay List all your components inside a sidebar For further information and functionality visit: https://github.com/brandung/bra_styleguide-widget Global JSImporterThe importer inserts your components into the page based on the conditions you set for your component. Capitan.Util.loadComponents = function () { $.import([ { condition: true, order: 0, fetch: [ [PUBLIC-FOLDER-PATH] + 'components/[COMPONENT-NAME]/component.js', [PUBLIC-FOLDER-PATH] + 'components/[COMPONENT-NAME]/component.css' ], callback: [ { method: function () { console.log('All dependencies have been loaded'); } } ], unique: '&lt;@unique@&gt;' } ]); } Option Description Possible Values condition Condition that defines if a component should be imported true: always import componentjQuery Object:import component if specific element is presentcustom function:import component if function returns true order defines in which order the components should be loaded Number fetch all the files that should be imported Array callback fires when all component files have been successfully imported unique timestamp for the component Number The import.js Github Repository: https://github.com/Webastronaut/import BundlesThe importer loads JS and CSS files on demand, so if you have components that depend on multiple files it is a good idea to combine those files into a bundle. This reduces the amount of requests. Bundles are generated through the grunt project:finish task. Example bundle: // &lt;@bundle#before-render Capitan.Vars.folderPath + 'js/util/console-polyfill.js', Capitan.Vars.folderPath + 'js/util/inject-smartresize.js', Capitan.Vars.folderPath + 'js/function/assert-breakpoint.js', Capitan.Vars.folderPath + 'js/function/get-breakpoint.js', Capitan.Vars.folderPath + 'js/function/get-orientation.js', Capitan.Vars.folderPath + 'js/function/get-computed-style.js', Capitan.Vars.folderPath + 'js/function/get-browser-version.js', Capitan.Vars.folderPath + 'js/function/get-viewport.js', Capitan.Vars.folderPath + 'js/util/set-breakpoints.js', Capitan.Vars.folderPath + 'js/handle/set-event-class.js', Capitan.Vars.folderPath + 'js/handle/resize-handler.js' // bundle@&gt;In this example the bundle file will be placed under [PUBLIC Folder] ├──js ├────bundle ├──────before-render-bundle.jsand the requests are reduced from two to one single request. IMPORTANT: A bundle can not contain JS and CSS files at the same time. Those have to be put into separate bundles. Recurring dependenciesIf you have components that share the same dependencies you can add an import to the fetchBeforeRender method. Capitan.Util.fetchBeforeRender = function () { return $.import([ { ... }, { condition: [$('.need-component-1'), $('.need-component-2'), $('.need-component-3')], fetch: [ [PUBLIC-PATH] + 'components/[COMPONENT-NAME]/component.js', [PUBLIC-PATH] + 'components/[COMPONENT-NAME]/component.css' ], unique: '&lt;@unique@&gt;' } ], false); };Functions, Utils and HandlesFunctions, Utils and Handles are the first scripts loaded by the Importer in the fetchBeforeRender-Function (before the DOM is ready). This makes sure that they are available within our components. These scripts will be loaded globally on every page. Functions: Function-Scripts are small modules with only one task and a single return value Utils: A Util can be used for the initialisation of polyfills or plugins that are needed globally Handles: They handle global events like window resize or scroll events inside the document AnnotationsThe following annotation are used as a marker for additional actions within a task. IMPORTANT: Never delete one of these annotations. Annotation File type Connected task Description &lt;@delete/delete@&gt; jsscss grunt project:finish deletes the code within these annotation &lt;@unique@&gt; js grunt project:finish gets replaced by a timestamp for the importer &lt;@bundle#[BUNDLE_NAME]/bundle@&gt; js grunt project:finish combines JS or CSS files into a bundle file under the given name and includes it in the main.js file &lt;@newComponent@&gt; tpljs grunt create:component marker to insert new component into global.js and _modules.tpl SystemsFor every system like Wordpress or Magento a custom JSON-file can be applied. All systems are located in the capitan/grunt/systems/ folder. The default, TYPO3 and ZEND system are already part of the capitan workflow. Add a new systemIf you want to add your own system file you can take one of the existing systems as a starting point. { &quot;folder&quot;: [ &quot;../dist/components&quot;, &quot;../dist/css&quot;, &quot;../dist/fonts&quot;, &quot;../dist/img/&quot;, &quot;../dist/js/libs/bra&quot;, &quot;../dist/js/libs/vendor&quot; ], &quot;root&quot;: &quot;..&quot;, &quot;private&quot;: &quot;src&quot;, &quot;public&quot;: &quot;dist&quot;, &quot;liveURL&quot;: &quot;&quot;, &quot;route&quot;: { &quot;/dist&quot;: &quot;../dist&quot; } }System foldersInside the folder array you can specify the public folders that should be created when running the init task. It is important that the default folders always be there. Additional folder can be added individual. The folder path is relative to your 'capitan' folder! { &quot;folder&quot;: [] }root pathSet the root path. The root path is relative to your 'capitan' folder (without trailing slash)! { &quot;root&quot;: &quot;..&quot; }Private folderThe folder where your private assets are placed. These should not be edited. { &quot;private&quot;: &quot;src&quot; }Public folderThe folder where your compiled private files will be generated. { &quot;public&quot;: &quot;&quot; }Live URLHere you can set the project path for the live server. { &quot;liveURL&quot;: &quot;&quot; }RouteIf your live server paths differ from your local project paths, you can set routes to map those paths correctly (see an example in the typo3.json). { &quot;route&quot;: { &quot;[LOCALPATH]/Resources&quot;: &quot;Resources/&quot; } } × Search results Close "},"tutorial-example.html":{"id":"tutorial-example.html","title":"Tutorial: example","body":" Capitan Tutorials example Global _basicScrollgetCookieinitloadComponentsloadDependenciesloadPolyfillssetCookie example Examplehttp://usejsdoc.org/about-tutorials.html × Search results Close "}}
